# Introduction #

I thought it would be a good idea to collect things which should be done before releasing kolab-android to the Android market. It's great to see more and more people using our stuff now, but I'd like to see a proper version where updates are smooth etc, before offering it to (non-tech) people which get our product via the market.


# Details #

  * **MUST HAVES**
    * Contact sync information stored with contacts2.db (simplifies updates)
    * Calender sync information in calendar.db (is that possible?)
    * Very good & fancy Contact Editor (Have a look at "Contact Editor" from dmfs in the market, he build one out of the android sources i.e. it looks the same and supports other syncadapters)

  * **Nice to have**
    * More detailed information for users in status
      * Ability to click on "x items conflicted" and see the items (maybe in a later step, see what exactly went wrong)
    * More than one Account, to support more than one phone book & calendar
