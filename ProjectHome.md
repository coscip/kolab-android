This connector synchronizes [Android](http://www.android.com/)'s addressbook and calendar to an IMAP folder in the [Kolab2 format](http://www.kolab.org/doc/kolabformat-2.0rc7-html/index.html).

[Kolab](http://www.kolab.org/) is a free groupware server.

We also work on a [connector for Outlook](http://code.google.com/p/kolab-outlook).

There are other [connectors for Kolab](http://www.kolab.org/kolab-clients) available from third parties.

Currently, this is a developer preview. The project can eat all your data.
